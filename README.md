 Public version of the Scenario-based Projection for the International trade Network algorithm.
 
 The main command is the spin() function in the code/interface_spin.py script.
 An example run is provided in code/example_run.py.
 The example run permits generating the covid SPIN-MRIO dataset ('The covid-SPIN MRIO dataset: Global trade network data for the years 2016-2026 reflecting the COVID-19 pandemic', Nature Scientific Data (In review)).
